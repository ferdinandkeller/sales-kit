# SalesKit

SalesKit is a tool for quickly creating guiding material for your clients.
It works by providing a simple chatbot what your client is looking for, and then uses your internal data (excel sheets and powerpoint presentations) to generate a complete and personalized sales kit for them.

By mixing a simple chat interface & a powerful templating engine, SalesKit is able to generate advanced content in a matter of seconds.
